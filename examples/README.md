## Hands on Spot

These examples should provide you some basic tools to proceed through the project in this semester.
We build them from the templates provided by the examples of BostonDynamics (so have a look at them too!).

Additionally, we try to use the code from the groups of former semesters as a starting point for you. 
We want to continue this. So if you create code this semester, comment it well.
Then it can be built upon for the groups to come.
