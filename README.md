# Project Mobile Robotics
## Main Changes
- Environment mapping and navigation are implemented inside the /mapping folder. Please refer to the README.md file inside the folder for more information.
This repository provides the codebase and an initial structure for the Mobile Robotics project of the Chair of 
Automatic Control at FAU. The intention of the repository is to provide you with all the required tools and examples that allow a 
quick head start into the project.

## Getting started


We use the Spot Python SDKs. Therefore, we highly recommend to have a look at https://dev.bostondynamics.com/readme for 
the conceptual documentation, the installation process and the Python client library.

### required software

- Python 3.8.20 (Please use this version!):  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/

### Project Repository

create a workspace directory on your computer. Clone the repository in it and update the submodules

    git clone https://gitlab.cs.fau.de/lrt/practical-seminar-mobile-robotics.git
    cd  practical-seminar-mobile-robotics
    git submodule update --init --recursive

## Hello Spot

... the first in-person session of this course will cover the basics like communicating with Spot and using the robot_wrapper as a basis for your project.
