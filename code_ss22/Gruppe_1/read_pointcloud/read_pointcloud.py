        # - walk around the room in order to build up the map and improve quality of the map
        # - stop walking
        # - download the current map
        # - extract pointcloud from it using methods form extract_point_cloud.py
        # - do postprocessing to find out which room we're in
        # - if room is ambiguous try walking out of the room and create a larger graph
        # - then fit the graph to the blueprint using graph nav anchoring optimization
